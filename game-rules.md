# GAME RULES

## Unit stats

Units are described with "Missile fire attack" or "Melee attack" rolls, described by the format: [Number of dice]d[faces of dice]/[number of figures]f. 

They can also have flat additions unrelated to the number of figures, in the following format: [Number of dice]d[faces of dice]/[number of figures]f + [Number of dice]d[faces of dice].

## SCRUD: Simple Combat Resolution Using Dice 

## Main roll mechanism
Players throw a pool of dice, defined in number and type by the stat appropriate for the situation, and compare the results: the top value thrown by player A is compared to the top value of player B, then the second best value of player A is compared to the second best of player B, etc. If one of the players has exceeding dice compared to the other, the lowest scoring are discarded. The sum of comparisons won determines which side is victorious. Draws are discarded.

### Bonus roll mechanism
Bonuses are awarded to SCRUD rolls by rolling in a different dice color 50% of the total dice normally thrown, substituting the low scoring rolls of the same die type of the main dice pool with the bonus ones if they are better. The quantity of bonus dice is rounded down with a minimum guaranteed of 1 bonus die. In case the unit has mixed die types in the pool, use the most prominent as a bonus die type. In case of draws, roll a die to decide. Bonuses are not cumulative, the best one is the one applied.

## Combat resolutions

### Melee resolution
Both attacker and defender rolls a pool of dice in the number and type described in their "Melee attack". Results are compared using SCRUD: for every comparison won by the attacker, a figure is removed from the defender side; if it is won by the defender, a figure is removed from the attacker side. The side winning most dice comparisons is declared winner of the melee.

### Missile fire resolution
The attacker rolls the number and type of dice described in its "Missile fire attack", keeping only 5+ results. The defender rolls a pool of 'Missile dodge' dice equal to the number of successes kept by the attacker, but limited to a maximum of prescribed dice per figure remaining in the target unit. 
Results are compared using SCRUD: for every comparison won by the attacker, a figure is removed from the defender side. If the defender side wins the comparison, no actions are taken on the attacker units. The side winning most dice comparisons is declared winner of the combat.
Artillery causes 2 casualties per comparison won.

### Indirect fire
The SCRUD “Missile attack” roll for indirect fire changes the type of die used, passing from d8 to d6, and the range is reduced by 25%. Units using d6 are not allowed to use indirect fire.
